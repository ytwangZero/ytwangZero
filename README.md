### Hi there 👋<br>
I'm Yuting, a current master’s student in <a href="https://gearpku2020.github.io//">**GEAR**</a></li>, having completed my undergraduate studies at the School of Public Health, Peking University. My primary research focus lies in environmental health and epigenetic epidemiology. Additionally, I hold a keen interest in machine learning and the development of R packages associated with this field.
